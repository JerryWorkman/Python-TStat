# tstat_gcal.py
# Script to pull commands from Google Calendar and update thermostat.
#
# Requirements:
# * gdata (http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)
# * ElementTree (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm)
# * Python-TStat (same place you got this script)
#
# Usage:
# 1. Create a Google/GMail account (or Google Apps for domains).
# 2. Go to http://calendar.google.com
# 3. Create a calendar (called "Thermostat" for example).
# 4. Add events with titles of the form:
#	 "Heat 70"	-- sets heat to 70 degrees
#	 "Cool 70"	-- sets cool to 70 degrees
#	 "Fan On"	-- forces fan on
#	 "Mode Off" -- forces system off
# 5. Run the following commands (assuming Unix/Linux system):
#	 echo "youraccount@gmail.com" >> ~/.google
#	 echo "yourpassword" >> ~/.google
#	 chmod 400 ~/.google
#	 (where "youraccount@gmail.com" is the account that you created in 
#	  step 1 and "yourpassword" is your password)
# 6. Add the following to your crontab to run every 5 minutes or so:
#	   TStatGcal.py <thermostat_address> <calendar_name>
#	 Where <thermostat_address> is the IP address of your thermostat 
#	 and <calendar_name> is the name of the calendar you created in 
#	 step 3.
#
# Notes:
#	 In order to limit the chance that this script sets your 
#	 thermostat to dangerous settings (e.g. too low or off during 
#	 the winter, there are some override variables below:
#	   HEAT_MIN, HEAT_MAX: Minimum/maximum setting for heat
#	   COOL_MIN, COOL_MAX: Minimum/maximum setting for cool
#	   COMMANDS: What parts of the thermostat the script is 
#				 allowed to control
#
#	 Set the HEAT/COOL variables to appropriate values for your 
#	 situation.	 By default, this script will not set the 
#	 thermostat mode (on/off/auto).	 You probably want to leave 
#	 it on auto.  This is to prevent a hacker (or a typo) from 
#	 turning your furnace off during the winter.  
#
#	 By default, this script does not disable cloud updates. 
#	 That way, if this script does not run for some reason (e.g. 
#	 if your computer crashes), you can still have a reasonable 
#	 backup program running.  When the cloud updates your thermostat,
#	 there may be a short period where the setting does not match
#	 what is on your calendar.	If this behavior is undesirable, you
#	 can disable cloud updates.	 
#
#	 At the start time of your event, the script will set the 
#	 the thermostat to the requested setting.  The duration of the 
#	 events on your calendar is ignored.  For example, a simple
#	 program might look like this:
#	   6:30 -- Heat 70
#	   8:00 -- Heat 60
#	  16:00 -- Heat 70
#	  22:00 -- Heat 60
#	 In order to create this program in your calendar, you would need 
#	 four events.  If you create a "Heat 70" event that lasts from 
#	 6:30-22:00 and an overlapping "Heat 60" event that lasts from 
#	 8:00-16:00, you will effectively miss the "Heat 70" command at 
#	 16:00.	 Only the start time of the event is used.	

# Minimum and maximum values for heat and cool
# The script will never set values outside of this range
HEAT_MIN = 55
HEAT_MAX = 80
COOL_MIN = 70
COOL_MAX = 100

# Valid commands
# Remove commands that you don't want the script to execute here
# mode in particular can be dangerous, because someone could create 
# a 'mode off' command and turn your heat off in the winter.
